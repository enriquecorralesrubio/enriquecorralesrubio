## Hi everyone ðŸ‘‹

As a web developer with a passion for creating efficient and innovative web solutions, I have successfully built several websites using a variety of technologies. My expertise lies in JavaScript and PHP, and I am particularly proficient with frameworks like Angular for front-end development and Symfony and Laravel for back-end development.

In past experiences, I have developed a solid understanding of web-related technologies, including Docker for containerization, CSS and HTML for responsive design, and SQL for database management. My hands-on experience with these tools and technologies has allowed me to deliver robust and scalable web applications.

I have developed MyVideogameList, a web application built with Angular (frontend) and Symfony (backend). In it, you can create a list to organize your own video games and many other features. Check out the repository's README for more information! :rocket:
