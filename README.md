## Hi everyone ðŸ‘‹

As a web developer with a passion for creating efficient and innovative web solutions, I have successfully built several websites using a variety of technologies. My expertise lies in JavaScript and PHP, and I am particularly proficient with frameworks like Angular for front-end development and Symfony and Laravel for back-end development.

In past experiences, I have developed a solid understanding of web-related technologies, including Docker for containerization, CSS and HTML for responsive design, and SQL for database management. My hands-on experience with these tools and technologies has allowed me to deliver robust and scalable web applications.
